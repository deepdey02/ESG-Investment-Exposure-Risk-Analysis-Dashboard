# ESG-Investment-Exposure-Risk-Analysis-Dashboard
Project Overview

Investment firms today face growing pressure to ensure their portfolios align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards. ESG is no longer just a “nice-to-have”; it is central to responsible investment decisions.

This project, “ESG Investment Exposure & Risk Analysis Dashboard”, is a Power BI-based dashboard that helps investment firms monitor ESG performance, manage portfolio risk, and make informed, responsible investment decisions.

The dashboard consolidates ESG scores, environmental metrics, and financial indicators across companies, sectors, regions, and time — all in one place.

What is ESG?

ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. These three pillars measure a company’s sustainability, ethical behavior, and management practices:

1️⃣ Environmental (E)

Measures how a company impacts the environment.
Metrics & Examples:

Carbon Emissions: Pollution from factories or transport
Example: BlackRock evaluates companies’ CO₂ reduction efforts before investing.

Energy Usage & Water Consumption

2️⃣ Social (S)

Measures how a company treats people inside and outside the organization.
Metrics & Examples:

Employees: Fair wages and safe working conditions

Diversity & Inclusion: Representation in leadership roles

Customer Satisfaction: Ethical treatment of customers

Community Impact: Contributions to local communities
Example: Citi Bank scores high in Gender Pay Equity and Employee Well-being.

3️⃣ Governance (G)

Measures how well a company is managed and run.
Metrics & Examples:

Board Structure: Independent and diverse boards

Business Ethics: Avoiding corruption and bribery

Transparency: Honest financial reporting

Shareholder Rights: Treating investors fairly
Example: JP Morgan monitors whistleblower policies and ethical audits.

Problem Statement

Investment firms face challenges such as:

ESG data is scattered, inconsistent, and hard to analyze.

Firms want to invest responsibly but need insights on actual ESG performance.

Detecting greenwashing — companies that appear sustainable but are not.

Solution: This dashboard consolidates ESG, environmental, and financial data, providing a single view to assess risk, investment exposure, and ESG performance across companies and sectors.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Records: 11,000+

Columns: 16 covering ESG scores, environmental metrics, financial indicators, industry, region, and year.
